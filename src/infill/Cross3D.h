/*!
 * Cross3D is a class for generating the Cross 3D infill pattern with varying density accross X, Y and Z.
 * Each layer is a space filling curve and across the layers the pattern forms a space filling surface,
 * which satisfied overhang angle and has no bridges.
 * 
 * The 3D surface is oscillating / pulsating in and out across the layers.
 * This way it touches itself and creates a foam like structure which is similarly flexible in all directions.
 * 
 * An underlying subdivision structure is generated, which subdivides the 3D space into regular parts: prisms.
 * These prisms have a triangular base and rectangular sides.
 * The prism heights correspond to half the wave length of the oscillation pattern:
 * the surface patch across a prism is either expanding or contracting.
 * 
 * For a layer each prism crossing that layer is sliced into a triangle.
 * The triangle grid thus created for a layer is then used to generate a Sierpinski-like fractal, similar to \ref SierpinskiFill
 * 
 * TODO: remove the code duplication of the SierpinskiTriangle.
 * 
 * Because the space filling curve can be seen as a way to linearize 2D space,
 * the 3D space filling surface is similar to a 2D square subdivision grid.
 * Quantization error is the error between actual density of a prism cell and required density of the user specified distribution.
 * Quantizatoin error should be distributed in two dimensions:
 * 'left' and 'right' that is: along the curve itself in the XY plane
 * up and down in the Z dimension.
 * 
 * This class inherits from InfillFractal2D so that it can apply the 2D dithering principles to distribute
 * 
 * 
 * We start with a cubic aabb and splice that vertically into 2 prisms of type I: half-cubic.
 * A half-cubic prism is subdivided vertically into 2 quarter-cubic prisms.
 * A quarter cubic prism is subdivided vertically and horizontally into 4 half-cubic prisms.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This class is to be used as follows:
 * 1- Create an instance
 * 2- call some functions to initialize and to decide the subdivision level at each location
 * 3- on each layer: call function to generate a path from the subdivision structure
 * 
 * The most difficult algorithms cover deciding the subdivision level at each location;
 * they are handled with in \ref InfillFractal2D.
 * See the class documentation of that class to get a better picture of how Cross3D infill works.
 * 
 * The most difficulty in this class is in converting a cell to the segment of the space filling curve.
 * There is quite some functionality in place to circumvent places in the cell which could lead to overlapping toolpaths.
 * Also realizing pockets in the pattern is rather difficult if neighboring cells differ in subdivision level.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Triangle subdivision explanation adopted from SierpinskiFill
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Triangles are subdivided into two children like so:
 * |\       |\        .
 * |A \     |A \      .
 * |    \   |    \    . where S is always the 90* straight corner
 * |     S\ |S____B\  .       The direction between A and B is maintained
 * |      / |S    A/
 * |    /   |    /      Note that the polygon direction flips between clockwise and SSW each subdivision
 * |B /     |B /
 * |/       |/
 * 
 * The direction of the space filling curve along each triangle is recorded:
 * 
 * |\                           |\                                        .
 * |B \  AS_TO_BS               |B \   AS_TO_AB                           .
 * |  ↑ \                       |  ↑ \                                    .
