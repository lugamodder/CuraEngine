/*!
 * InfillFractal2D is an abstract class for generating subdivisiong structures with varying levels of subdivision,
 * according to some requested density distribution given by a \ref DensityProvider
 * 
 * This class performs balancing and dithering on a '2D' subdivision fractal,
 * in abstraction of the actual geometric details of the subdivision fractal cells.
 * 
 * The way in which this class is 2D is that the error is dispersed along two directions.
 * For a simple square subdivision grid these are the X and Y axis,
 * but for the Cross3D fractal these are the Z axis and the XY axes.
 * 
 * Cells next to each other are constrained to be at most 1 subdivision level off from each other.
 * 
 * Because the XY plane for the Cross3D fractal is linearized by the Sierpinski-like fractal,
 * the fractal curve can be thought of as a single dimension.
 * A space filling fractal is said to linearize 2D space into a single dimension.
 * 
 * For the sake of simplicity of the explanation, further documentation will assume the terminology square subdivision fractal.
 * 'left' and 'right' would correspond to backward and forward along the space filling curve of a single layer.
 * 
 * For more information on how the 3D space filling surface is generated, see \ref Cross3D
 * 
 * This class deals with cells in abstraction of their geometric shape.
 * The cells are connected to their neighbors above and below, and to the cells left and right.
 * 
 * This class also deals with the tree of possible subdivisions,
 * and actually performs the subdivisions.
 * The connections with neighbors are only recorded for the current actual nodes;
 * i.e. the nodes for which the parents have been chosen to be subdivided.
 * 
 * Several algorithms are implemented to decide the subdivision level at each location.
 * They differ in how constraints between neighbors are resolved and
 * at which side of the requested density a node is - more or less dense than requested.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Because a subdivision structure has discrete steps of possible infill density,
 * there is likely a discrepancy between the requested density of a cell and the actualized density.
 * This difference is known as 'quantiziation error'.
 * However, the term 'error' is ambiguous as to the directionality:
 * a negative error could mean there is more requested density than actualized density, but it might as well mean the opposite.
 * 
 * Therefore we adopt the terminology of money: 'value'.
 * The requested amount of material for a cell is called its 'allowance'.
 * If a cell is subdivided more than its allowance then it is said to be 'in debt'.
 * Such a debt can be resolved by taking on a 'loan' from neighboring cells.
 * The value balance of a cell is the allowance plus the total borrowed value minus the value loaned to other cells.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The main complexity of this class is in deciding the subdivision level at each location.
 * 
 * 
 * DATA STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 * =======================
 * All possible cells of the subdivision structure form a tree,
 * with the root node(s) equal to the starting shapes of the subdivision structure.
 * 
 * In order to efficiently store the whole tree, all node are stored in a vector,
 * and instead of having pointers to children on the heap, cells have vector indices as references to their children.
 * Because Cross3D cells sometimes have 2 children and sometimes have 4, the parent child indices cannot be related using a simple mathematical formula.
 * 
 * Next the data structures need to support choosing at which subdivision level the structure will be actualized at each location.
 * Each cell therefore has a field \ref InfillFractal2D::Cell::is_subdivided
 * 
 * Furthermore, neighboring actualized cells are linked to each other in order to efficiently transfer loans between the two.
 * Note that only actualized cells are linked, i.e. cells for which the parent has is_subdivided == true.
 * 
 * For each cardinal direction (left, right, down, up) we link the cells neighboring this cell.
 * Each link has a field to record how much value loan the departure location cell borrows to the destination cell.
 *
 * Each link also has a reference to the iterator to the reverse link.
 * That way we can efficiently insert new links, when changing the link graph due to a subdivision.
 * 
 * The data structure has these two parts at the same time:
 * The tree and the neighborhood graph.
 * 
 * Visualization of double data structure:
 * 
 *                                 root

 * 
 * ALGORITHM OVERVIEW
 * ==================
 * 1) Generate the tree of all possible cells and their subdivisions
 * 2) Decide at which 'height' in the tree the eventual pattern will be: decide on the recursion depth at each location
 * 3) Generating toolpaths
 * 
 * 1) Tree generation
 * - Make (dummy) root node
 * - add first prisms by hand
 * - recursively set the required volume, the actual volume etc.
 * 
 * 2) Create subdivision pattern
 * We start from the root and only decide for each node whether we subdivide it or not;
 * we never 'unsubdivide' a node.
 * All nodes which have been chosen to be subdivided are marked as such in \ref Cross3D::Cell::is_subdivided
 * As such the creation of the subdivision structure is a boundary on the subdivision tree which is only pushed downward toward the leaves of the tree.
 * 
 * The current subdivision structure is a net of linked cells.
 * The cells have the following info:
 * - the geometric prism/square
 * - links to neighboring cells in the current subdivision structure
 * - requested density: allowance
 * 
 * There are several ways in which to decide on the recurison depth at each location.
 * 
 * 2.1) Minimal required density
 * - made easily by recursively subdiviging each cell (and neighbording restructing cells) which is lower than the required density
 * 
 * 2.2) Average density
 * First we decide on the minimal density at each location, while keeping density change cascades balanced around input density requirement changes.
 * Then we apply dithering to get the eventual subdivision pattern
 * 
 * 2.2.1) Average density lower boundary
 * This is 50% of the complexity of this class.
 * This is the most difficult algorithm.
 * Cells with enough allowance to subdivide, but which are constrained by neighbors hand out loans to the contraining neighbor.
 * Near regions where the input density requirement distribution has sharp edges,
 * this causes the change in output density to lie on both sides of the input edge.
 * That way no global error is accumulated because the allowance is invested locally.
 * More on this algorithm below.
 * 
 * 2.2.2) Dithering
 * Walk over the subdivision structure from the left bottom to the top right
 * decide for each cell whether to subdivide once more or not,
 * without reconsidering the thus introduced children for subdivision again.
 * Propagate induced error forward to yet unprocessed cells.
 * 
 * 
 * 3) Generating toolpaths
 * Toolpath generation for square subdivision is quite straight forward. See \ref SquareSubdiv.
 * The following explanation is for \ref Cross3D:
 * For each layer there is a single linear sequence of prisms to cross.
 * In order to efficiently compute the sequence,
 * we compute once a mapping from z coordinates to sequence starting cells
 * and from a starting cell we compute the whole sequence of cells for a given layer.
 * 
 * For such a sequence we look at all triangles of all prisms in the sequence.
 * From this sequence of triangles, we can generate a Sierpinski curve,
 * or the CrossFill curve.
 * When generating the curve, we make sure not to overlap with other line segments in the crossfill pattern.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ===========================
 * == Detailed explanations ==
 * ===========================
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2.2.1) Average density lower boundary. a.k.a. createBalancedPattern(.)
 * The algorithm for creating the lower bound sequence is as such:
 * do
 *   1. subdivisionPhase(): subdivide each cell which can
 *   2. handOutLoansPhase(): let each cell which wants to subdivide, but which is constrained hand out loans to their constrainers
 * until converged.
 * 
 * It is conjectured that convergence happens at most at step max_depth + 2,
 * meaning that it could suffice to do only max_depth + 1 steps, without the extra step to check for convergence.
 * However, I don't have proof.
 * 
 * Both phases handle cells in an order based on cell recursion depth,
 * so that loans or paybacks/settlements cascade.
 * 
 * In the subdivision phase unused loan amounts are paid back just before performing a subdivision.
 * That means we first have to consider the most constraining cell, i.e. the lowest recursion depth cell, closest to the root,
 * so we move from lower recursion depth to higher recursion depth.
 * Then the cells with higher recursion depth (denser cells) get subdivided with the aid of th settlement of previously handled cells.
 * 
 * In the handOutLoansPhase new loans are made;
 * cells which are constrained by neighbors hand out loans to their constrainers.
 * They hand out as much loan as possible given that they would still be able to subdivide;
 * that's how much value they have left over.
 * That means the most constrained cells need to be processed first, i.e. the most dense cells with highest recursion depth.
 * They hand out loans to the constrainers of lower recursion depth, so that they in turn can hand out more loans to their constrainers.
 * 
 * 
 * If there are multiple constrainers or mutiple loans for one given cell in either phase described above,
 * then we need a way to determine which loan will be settled by how much and which constrainer will get which portion of the left-overs.
 * In case of new loans the left over value is divided equally.
 * In case of settlements the loans are paid back proportional to the amount of loan.
 * It is conjectured that these rules lead to allowance being used as locally and efficiently as possible.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * At the end of the phase (2.2.1) Average density lower boundary / after this phase:
 * all loans handed out are settled back in as much as possible.
 * The loaning should only have effect in phase 2.2.1 and not have any effect on the next phase: dithering.
 * 
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Subdivision
 * ----
 * When subdividing, we first settle loans with leftover value borrowed - if applicable.  >> settleLoans(.)
 * Then we need to transfer some value in order to have all realized volume accounted for by the allowance.
 * 
 * Performing a subdivision itself induces some value to be transfered, because of two reasons:
 * 1. loans handed out to the parent should be transfered to children
 *      >> transferLoans(.)
 * 2. the children cells are unbalanced, i.e. the allowance of the children differs wildly
 *      >> solveChildDebts(.)
 * 
 * 1. If a cell to be subdivided still had loans from neighboring cells,
 * then these loans need to be transfered to the children.
 * If the children have a deeper recursion depth than the loaner cells,
 * then the loan needs to be split among the children.
 * We divide the loans equally amongst the children - by lack of a principled alternative.
 * 
 * 2. Example: (using two children only, for simplicity)
 * parent has 100 allowance, but realizes 70
 * child_1: has 100 allowance, realizes 50
 * child_2: has 0 allowance, realizes 50
 * (verify that the children together have the same allowance ofs the parent)
 * 
 * child_2 should not be able to exist as such because it doesn't have enough value for its current subdivision level.
 * We therefore need to introduce loans to make each hcild have a non-negative value balance.
 * Because the subdivision is possible we knwo that there is enough vlaue to go around,
 * so we introduce loans between neighboring children until each child has a non-negative balance.
 * 
 * We first apply 1, so that step 2 can take care of any imbalance incurred by either step 1 or by unbalanced children.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------
 * 2.2.2) Dithering. a.k.a. dither(.)
 * ----
 * 
 * For each cell we determine whether to subdivide it one step further or not,
 * by seeing whether its value balance is more or less than midway between the parent realized density and the children realized density.
 * 
 * The error thus induced is propagated forward to cells yet unprocessed.
 * This error is recorded as a loan - as ususal.
 * 
 * Because the subdivision structure is 2D, the error should be propagated in multiple directions.
 * A simple Floyd-Steinberg dither would work on a grid of same recursion depth cells.
 * The error in FS dithering is propagated to neighboring cells using a partition of unity using the following weights:
 * [ 3 5 1 ]  > cells above
 * [ _ * 7 ]  > forward cell
 *   : :
 *   : ^ current cell
 *   ^ already processed cells
 * 
 * However, because we are dealing with a subdivision structure we cannot process the cells in a row-based manner.
 * We do keep the general row-based order, though:
 *                       +-------+---+---+
 * Recursion rule        |       | 9 | 10| Complex case
 * +---+---+             |   6   +---+---+
 * | 3 | 4 |             |       | 7 | 8 |
 * +---+---+             +---+---+---+---+
 * | 1 | 2 |             | 3 | 4 |       |
 * +---+---+             +---+---+   5   |
 *                       | 1 | 2 |       |
 *                       +---+---+-------+
 * 
 * Note that when processing cells in this order, we cannot propagate error in the usual manner.
 * 1. First we establish that a cell might have multiple neighbors above,
 * as is the case for 5 in the example above: it has 7 and 8 as neighbor above.
 * 
 * 2. Second, some cells cannot propagate error to left-up, because that cell has been processed already,
 * as is the case for 7: above it is 9 and left of it is 6, which is processed before 7.
 * 
 * 3. For some cells, the left up neighbor, or the right up neighbor are equivalent to the upper neighbor,
 * as is the case for 4 and 3 resp.
 * 
 * 
 * In order to solve for a variable amount of neighboring cells,
 * we propagate error based on a partition of unity with weights determined by the direction similar to FS dithering
 * and also influenced by cell size (?)
 * 
 * We don't propagate error to cells already processed by the dithering algorith.
 * Those cells have the flag is_dithered set to true.
